# Securityhome_Backend

project was to develop a home security system that used facial recognition and Internet of Things Technology for the care and security of homes by analyzing the face of a person via CCTV with facial recognition technology and alert a mobile application automatically when a face does not match the face of a registered member. The process to teach the machine to learn the facial characteristics of family members used a training dataset developed with Python's OpenCV library. The system was divided into 2 parts: 1) Backend Service System, developed with Python on a Raspberry Pi that was connected to a CCTV camera and a speaker for the sounding the alarm, it also was responsible for providing various service functions for the mobile application that sends notifications and includes a face analysis function. The database was managed with MySQL; and 2) Front-end System of the mobile application runs on the Android operating system. Users can perform registration, add family memberâ€™s information, and call various services from Raspberry Pi developed which was all developed with Android Studio.
